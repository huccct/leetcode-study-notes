### **Title:**

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

### **Approach:**

**Method One**ï¼š

- We initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.
- We enter a while loop that continues as long as left is less than right. This ensures that we keep searching until the pointers meet.
- Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index mid using integer division.
- We compare the element at index mid with the element at index right:
  - If nums[mid] is greater than nums[right], it means the minimum element is located in the right half of the remaining search space. We update left to mid + 1 to search in the right half.
  - Otherwise, if nums[mid] is less than or equal to nums[right], it means the minimum element is located in the left half of the remaining search space, including the middle element. We update right to mid to search in the left half.

### **Code:**

**Method One:**

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMin = function (nums) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid;
    }
  }

  return nums[left];
};
```
