### **Title:**

https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/

### **Approach:**

**Method One**ï¼š
The problem can be solved using a stack to keep track of the directories in the path. We split the input path by slash '/', iterate over the directories, and perform the following operations:

- Ignore the current directory '.' and empty directories.
- Go one level up for double period '..' by popping the top element from the stack if it is not empty.
- For any other directory, push it to the stack.
- Finally, we join the directories in the stack with slash '/' and add a slash at the beginning to form the simplified canonical path.

### **Code:**

**Method One:**

```js
/**
 * @param {string} path
 * @return {string}
 */
var simplifyPath = function (path) {
  const stack = [];
  const directories = path.split('/');
  console.log(directories);
  for (let dir of directories) {
    if (dir === '.' || dir === '') continue;
    else if (dir === '..') stack.pop();
    else stack.push(dir);
  }
  return '/' + stack.join('/');
};
```
